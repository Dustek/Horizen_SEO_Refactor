# Horizen_SEO_Refactor

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to refractor the code for the HTML and CSS components of a Horiseon web page, making the code more readable and both the code and the website more accessible.

## Background

The project is particularly focused on making sure all the links work, the website has an appropriate title, and the code is consolidated and readable.

## Usage

The HTML of the website is laid out in a logical manner. The header controls the company logo as well as the navigation buttons.

The body of the HTML is laid out in two main parts: a section and an aside, both of which contain three articles with images. Finally, there is a footer.

Comments can be found in CSS, explaining each section and what it affects.

## Refactoring Process

I replaced the HTML elements (most of which were "div") with more appropriate and immediately understandable elements such as nav, header, section, etc. I also added "alt" attributes to images, describing them in text to make the site more accessible.

Furthermore, I fixed all the links leading to other elements of the page and added a title to the website, improving its SEO searchability and accessibility.

In terms of the CSS side, I re-organised some of the element classes and commented on them to make the stylesheet easier to understand. I also made the header, including navigation, fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls to improve the user experience.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to give credit to my instructor, Abdul, as well as all the TA's and fellow students who have helped me learn how to complete this project.
